### Build Week 1 Portfolio Project - Spotify Clone

> Our first Bootstrap5 project used to wet our feet using bootstraps standard components, no major frontend framework implemented, just a simple bootstrap one pager.

![screenshot](./strive-m2-d2-netlify-app.png)

Standard boostrap5, used the CDN to serve the css and javascript, will implement a build process in the next project.

#### Built With

- Major languages - HTML, CSS, Javascript(ES6)
- Frameworks - Bootstrap5
- Technologies - Netlify

#### Live Demo

[Live Demo Link](https://strive-m2-d10-benchmark-gogcom.netlify.app/)

#### Getting Started

**Git clone the repository and use live server or a simple server to serve the index.html in your browser, alternatively just open a browser and navigate to the cloned repo and launch index.html from there.**

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

##### Git commit guide

GIT commands refresher: 

- git pull - pulls latest changes from the remote upstream on whichever branch you are on
- git branch - shows all local branches
- git checkout (_branch name_) - switches to a new branch
- git checkout -b (_branch name_) - creates a new branch and switches to new branch
- git branch -d (_branch name_) - deletes branch
- git status - shows local file changes (edited and non committed or added files staged for commit once added to staging)
- git add . - adds all edited and changed local files to staging ready for commmit
- git commit -m "message" - commits all added staged files (basically think of committing like saving your files locally)
- git push - will push the files up to the remote / origin on the branch you are on.


1. Always switch into dev every new session and pull latest changes (you could do the same for master, so you always have up to date master and dev branch)
2. Create or switch to your own feature branch, don't work directly on dev/master/main (if not yet created, create a new feature branch from the latest dev branch)
3. Remember before merging make sure you always update and pull latest changes on dev
4. IMPORTANT, WHEN YOU MERGE YOUR FEATURE BRANCH INTO DEV AND YOU HAVE CONFLICTS DO NOT PUSH TO THE REMOTE, WE WILL RESOLVE THE CONFLICTS LOCALLY BEFORE CORRUPTING THE REMOTE DEV.
5. If you succesfully manage to merge feature into an up to date dev branch with no conflicts then you can push the commits upstream.

Hope this guide helps :).
