- Technologies - Netlify Hosting & CDN
- Infrastructure - Github CI

#### Devops

##### Team Git refresher guide (before pushing and merging ;)

- git pull - pulls latest changes from the remote upstream on whichever branch you are on
- git branch - shows all local branches
- git checkout (_branch name_) - switches to a new branch
- git checkout -b (_branch name_) - creates a new branch and switches to new branch
- git branch -d (_branch name_) - deletes branch
- git status - shows local file changes (edited and non committed or added files staged for commit once added to staging)
- git add . - adds all edited and changed local files to staging ready for commmit
- git commit -m "message" - commits all added staged files (basically think of committing like saving your files locally)
- git push - will push the files up to the remote / origin on the branch you are on.


1. Always switch into dev every new session and pull latest changes (you could do the same for master, so you always have up to date master and dev branch)
2. Create or switch to your own feature branch, don't work directly on dev/master/main (if not yet created, create a new feature branch from the latest dev branch)
3. Remember before merging make sure you always update and pull latest changes on dev
4. Important!!! Resolve any conflicts with your team mates if any arise while trying to merge your feature branch with the development branch.
5. If you manage to merge without conflicts then you can push your awesome work upstream to the origin remote.

Happy coding future ex google, ex facebook tech leads ;)
